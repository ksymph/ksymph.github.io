<h1>Why - and How - Blog?</h1>
<time datetime="2025-08-07 20:00">August 7, 2025</time>
<p>As is tradition with new blogs, the first post here should be about my fancy new blog setup. Over time, though, I've realized that the most important blog setup is actually in your heart; so I mostly wanted to talk about my plans for this space and what sort of vision finally helped me get it going (such as it is). I've been orbiting the blogosphere for a couple years now, and I've made a few false starts, but I think I'm finally ready for a real commitment.</p>

<p>First, let's get the technical housekeeping out of the way: this site is statically generated from a couple templates - blog.html and feed.xml - and post contents, which I write in raw HTML (what can I say, I don't mind it). The build script is just a little lua thing, 80 lines soaking wet with no dependencies, and it does some substitutions to put all the post contents where they need to be. Eventually I'll probably want to split the output into multiple pages but it's fine as it is.</p>

<p>Now, onward:</p>

<p>A very useful piece of advice for starting blogging (though it applies to just about any creative endeavor, to some extent) is "write for yourself". You'll also hear it as "be your own audience", "write what you want to read" and so on, but the core idea is that you have the ultimate feedback machine in yourself. As weird as you and what you have to say may be, statistically speaking there are going to be other weirdos whose tastes overlap with your own. It's better to write something you know at least one person is interested in than to try and appease the faceless and fickle mass of 'average person' that is assumed to be the audience by default but never is.</p>

<p>This is one of those rare pieces of advice that's actually useful, and there's a reason you'll see some variation of it on pretty much every successful blog (or at least, the weirdo blogs I keep up with lol). But I've found there's another piece to the puzzle.</p>

<p>The thing is, you can never read what you wrote for the first time. By the time you're writing about something, you've been immersed in its concepts long enough that they seem like a given. Putting your thoughts into writing is like a movie adaptation of a book you love; you already know the plot and characters, how it's going to end. Even on the off-chance it's done well, there's still an inescapable feeling of pointlessness to it all, because once you know the canonical True and Full Version Of Things - be it the book or the idea in your head - anything else just feels like a pale imitation.</p>

<p>And among that sort of general dissatisfaction lies a trap. "Ah," says the subconscious (as the audience member), "I already know all this. This is just a subpar adaptation of the complete understanding I have in my head. So what's the point?" Case in point, writing this post feels dumb and pointless because the trap seems so *obvious* now. Of course you won't enjoy the things you write as much as the thing you're trying to express with your writing - that's why you're trying to express it. But if I can't write with myself as the audience in mind, and writing to the 'average person' audience is a fruitless exercise in misery, then who should I be writing for?</p>

<p>That brings me to the guiding principle I've landed upon: write for yourself from the past. You're not writing for you, you're writing for you from before you understood what you're trying to explain. This post might not be of help to me now, but I think I would have liked to read it few months or years ago, when I was trying to break through the block and write something; and in that way, I hope it can be of help to someone else out there who runs into similar difficulties.</p>

<p>That's all I have to say. Until next time.</p>
