# Hello world!

## 1742243777

This is a post to test my blogging software.

I'm writing this in a markdown file that (hopefully) gets parsed and embedded from a link like /blog/2025/hello-world.

If all goes according to plan it should also be visible in a big list at /blog too.

It just occurred to me tags might be useful too. Hmm. Maybe later.
