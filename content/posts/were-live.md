# And we're live

There's the frontend done... ish. For now.

I'm not super happy with it, but whatever, it works. I'm just not really sure what direction to take it.

For this site in general I'm gravitating towards a sort of flat skeumorphic thing, using flat colors and simple lines to represent real objects that more or less correspond to the content/function - see <a href="/page/library/">The Library</a> as an example, where I keep my bookmarks as, well, books.

For the blog here I was thinking of styling the posts like signposts, or maybe like pieces of paper pinned to a bulletin board. How to make that look decent isn't immediately obvious to me though - and in the interest of having a functional blog I decided to just throw something together. The colors need tweaking but I'm kinda digging the orange and navy thing so I'll probably stick with that in some capacity.

I really need to mention how much of an inspiration <a href="https://crys.site/blog/">Michał's blog</a> has been. The styling similarities should be obvious (for the time being at least) - I pretty much copied it wholesale - but I was especially inspired by the kinds of posts he makes (and the frequency, wow!). 

I tried to write a full-length, high effort blog post once. It was so embarassingly bad I deleted it immediately upon finishing and swore to never make the same mistake again. But on the other hand, the Twitter/Mastodon microblog paradigm feels so slight, both to read and to write; there's enough space for the idea of an idea and not much else.

I think Michał nails it though. Some longer posts, some shorter, but most hang out in that 200-500 word sweet spot. The low stakes of microblogging with plenty of headroom for deeper dives. I don't know if there's a term for this style but needless to say I enjoy it immensely and will be taking this blog in a similar direction.

That's about it for now. There's still a ton of work to do here, like:

- RSS feeds
- tags/categories
- pagination
- <s>test markdown formatting</s>

and much more. But now I have a place to dump random thoughts I don't want to let fade away in my head so I'm happy.
