					<p>Hi, I'm K! You'll often find me under ksymph or other usernames.</p>

					<p>I make games, design websites, and work on other software from time to time. I enjoy working with tools that are simple and robust, and aim for the same in the things I create.</p>

					<p>In my free time, I love to learn. Any topic is fair game, but I'm particularly interested in paleontology and early spaceflight. You'll also find me watching movies, playing guitar, or surfing the small web.</p>

					<p>Check out what I've been working at <a href="projects">projects</a>, see what I have to say in my <a href="blog">blog</a>, or look for something you'd like to click on over in <a href="links">links</a>. If you want to say hi or find me somewhere else here are some things for you:</p>
