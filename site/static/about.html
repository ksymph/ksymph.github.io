					<p>
						Hello! I'm Kelton (as you might have gathered by now), a
						developer, perpetual potterer, and a proud
						<a href="https://sive.rs/slow">slow thinker</a>. Curiosity is
						my primary pillar; I love to learn, and I'm always looking to
						find answers to questions I didn't know to ask.
					</p>
					<p>
						Figuring out what to do with all the skills and snippets of
						knowledge I've picked up along the way comes a little less
						naturally though. So I'm on a journey to take a break from my
						wisdom-wicking wanderings, and start making. It's a different
						kind of learning, but an adventure all the same.
					</p>
					<p>
						This site comes out out of that journey; it began as a
						homemade web server running off a phone in my living room, and
						has since evolved into a custom static site generator running
						off GitHub pages.
