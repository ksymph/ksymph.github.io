			<p>I'm Kelton (as you may have noticed). I'm curious, careful, and a <a href="https://sive.rs/slow">slow thinker</a>. I love to learn and discover new knowledge; you'll find me diving ever deeper into anything that catches my eye.</p>
            <p>Retaining and applying that knowledge comes a little less naturally to me though. So I work hard to keep focused, and to build practical foundations for my interests through creating.</p>
            <p>To that end, this site is a culmination of years of undirected learning, and a focal point around which I aim to center my efforts. Earlier versions used a homemade web server running off a phone in my living room; now it's statically generated using a simple lua script. I've seen the edges of the world and am now ready to return home.</p>
            <p>Check out what I've been doing over in <a href="/projects">projects</a>, or see what I have to say over in <a href="/blog/">my blog</a>.</p>
