			<p>I'm Kelton (as you may have noticed). I'm curious, careful, and a <a href="https://sive.rs/slow">slow thinker</a>. I love to learn and discover new knowledge; you'll find me diving ever deeper into anything that catches my eye.</p>
            <p>Retaining and applying that knowledge comes a little less naturally to me though. So I work hard to keep focused, and to build practical foundations for my interests through creating.</p>
            <p>To that end, this site is a culmination of a long period of undirected learning, and a focal point around which to center my efforts going forward. Earlier versions used a homemade web server running off a phone in my living room; now it's statically generated using a simple lua script.</p>
