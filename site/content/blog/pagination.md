# Pagination!

## 1743899938

Wanted to add pagination before things got too out of hand. It was easier than I expected honestly, only around a dozen lines of code. I also touched up the sidebar.

The only things it really needs now are RSS and tags. This blog is unfocused to put it mildly so I think it'll be nice to have different feeds for each tag. Trying to properly tag things might end up being too much of a pain but we'll see.
