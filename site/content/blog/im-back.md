# I'm back!

## 1752006249

This year is either going by reall fast or really slow and I can't quite tell which. Either way, I'm here again! The blog is back up, and it's moved to a static site generator. Tweaking my own server was fun and rewarding, but took up a lot of time.

Over the past few months I've been working on focusing my efforts more. There are so many things I'm interested in, but only so much time and headspace I can devote to each. So I want to pare down a little. I've converted most of my sites to be static which means I can just throw them on github and not worry about managing a server. I've also finally accepted that I'm never going to write a novel lol. That's an important step in one's life, I think.

Anyway, I'm really just writing this to break the ice. I have some longer blog posts in mind, but I'd like to get back(?) into the swing of things before diving in. I'd also like to clean up the site a little, add an RSS feed.
