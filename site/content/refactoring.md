# Refactoring is a natural part of life

I often fall into the trap of trying to get everything right the first time. And it is a trap, because it's just not possible. You don't know what you don't know you need to know, yknow?

No matter how carefully you plan things out, it'll never go as planned. This is true both of life and of programming. I think part of draw of programming is that, moreso than life, there's a promise of perfection; that if you can just plan your structure perfectly from the start the rest will be easy. To some extent it's true - measure twice and all that - but as with seemingly every aphorism the opposite is just as often the case.

So it's important to recognize refactoring as a fundamental part of the process, both of life and programming. It's not a failure to halt forward progress for a moment and regroup any more than it's a failure for a tree to lay dormant in the winter. Don't ask for asparagus in January, and you'll have a few more bills in your purse.
